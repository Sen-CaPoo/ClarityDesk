- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review

✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on business capabilities (LINE integration, notification, problem reporting) without mentioning specific technologies, frameworks, or implementation approaches.

✅ **PASS** - All content emphasizes user value: improving notification timeliness, providing convenient reporting channels, and reducing reporting barriers.

✅ **PASS** - Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders, using plain business terms (綁定、推送通知、回報問題) rather than technical jargon.

✅ **PASS** - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully completed with comprehensive details.

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **PASS** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers found. All requirements are specific and well-defined.

✅ **PASS** - All 24 functional requirements are testable with clear expected behaviors. Examples:

- FR-001: Can test by verifying button exists and is clickable
- FR-009: Can verify message contains all specified fields
- FR-021: Can verify LINE-created reports appear in web system

✅ **PASS** - All 8 success criteria include measurable metrics:

- SC-001: Time-based (1 minute)
- SC-002: Time-based (10 seconds)
- SC-005: Percentage-based (90%)
- SC-007: Satisfaction percentage (85%)

✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are purely outcome-focused without implementation details:

- Uses "使用者可在 X 時間內完成" instead of "API 回應時間"
- Uses "推送通知在 X 秒內送達" instead of "LINE Messaging API 效能"

✅ **PASS** - All 3 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format. Total 18 acceptance scenarios across all stories.

✅ **PASS** - Edge cases section identifies 7 important boundary conditions:

- Unbinding after binding
- Timeout handling
- Service unavailability
- Duplicate binding prevention
- Missing default assignees
- Input validation errors
- Deleted/modified report links

✅ **PASS** - Scope is clearly defined through 3 prioritized user stories (P1: Binding, P2: Notifications, P3: LINE reporting). Each story explains why it has that priority.

✅ **PASS** - Dependencies implicitly addressed through priority ordering (P1 is foundation for P2 and P3). Edge cases identify assumptions about default assignees and timeout policies.

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **PASS** - Each of 24 functional requirements maps to specific acceptance scenarios in user stories. For example:

- FR-009 → User Story 2, Scenario 2 (message content verification)
- FR-015 → User Story 3, Scenario 2 (guided conversation flow)

✅ **PASS** - User scenarios cover complete workflows:

- User Story 1: Binding lifecycle (bind, view status, unbind)
- User Story 2: Notification flow (create → notify → open link)
- User Story 3: End-to-end LINE reporting (start → fill → confirm → receive)

✅ **PASS** - 8 success criteria directly align with the 3 user stories and provide measurable business outcomes (time reduction, success rates, user satisfaction).

✅ **PASS** - Final review confirms no technical implementation details present. Specification remains at business/user requirement level throughout.

## Summary

**Status**: ✅ ALL CHECKS PASSED

The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the next phase. No updates required.

## Notes

- Specification demonstrates excellent prioritization with clear rationale for P1 (foundation), P2 (core value), P3 (convenience)
- Edge cases are comprehensive and show thorough consideration of failure scenarios
- Measurable outcomes balance quantitative metrics (time, percentages) with qualitative measures (satisfaction)
- All requirements are independently testable without implementation knowledge
